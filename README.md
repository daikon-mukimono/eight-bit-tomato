A super-silly pomodoro timer made using the NES.css framework

I have been coding for years and years but this is the first time I write anything that could be considered a web application, and the first time in years I write something not under an NDA. I was vaguely doing the freecodecamp front-end libraries curriculum but I was itching to create *something*. I came across the NES.css framework and decided to use that aesthetic to try one of the projects. 

This pomodoro timer started it's life as a pokemon-themed app. I was going to give it to a friend for her birthday, but then I decided I wanted the chime to be the SMB success sound. I wanted the whole thing to be consistent, hence Mario.
I made this project using jQuery. I know it's old technology, but it seems important to learn anyway. It's on enough job applications. In hindsight, however, I would have done it using vanilla JS. JQuery is just another framework, and understading how the language works is more important. So whatever I do next I think I will use some vanilla JS before tackling things using React or Angular or Vue.

One thing I learned writing this is that the proprietary language I use at work has more in common with JS than with C++, despite needing to be compiled. Once that clicked, everything was super easy---I was even able to predict the existence of methods from what I have used at work.

It's kind of neat making something and being able to share it.
